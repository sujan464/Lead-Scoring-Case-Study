# Lead-Scoring-Case-Study
## Objective
X Education, an online course provider for industry professionals, attracts numerous potential customers daily through marketing efforts on websites and search engines like Google. Visitors to the website can browse courses, watch videos, or fill out a form providing their contact details. Those who complete the form are classified as leads, with additional leads coming from past referrals.

Once leads are acquired, the sales team engages them through calls and emails. However, with a conversion rate of just 30%, the company struggles to efficiently convert leads. For instance, out of 100 daily leads, only about 30 typically convert.

To improve efficiency, X Education aims to identify "Hot Leads"—those with the highest potential to convert. By focusing efforts on these leads, the sales team can significantly improve conversion rates.

Your task is to build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score (0–100) to each lead. A higher score indicates a "hot" lead likely to convert, while a lower score indicates a "cold" lead. Additionally, the model should be flexible enough to adapt to future company needs and address specific challenges outlined separately. Be sure to include these aspects and your recommendations in the final presentation.
